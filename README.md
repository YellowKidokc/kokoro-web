## üß† Model

Kokoro Web is powered by [hexgrad/Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M), an open-weight 82 million parameter Text-to-Speech model available on Hugging Face.

> Despite its lightweight architecture, it delivers comparable quality to larger models while being significantly faster and more cost-efficient. With Apache-licensed weights, Kokoro can be deployed anywhere from production environments to personal projects.

This is one of the top-ranked models in [TTS Arena](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TTS-AGI/TTS-Arena), just behind ElevenLabs.

Special thanks to the model creators for making this technology accessible.

## üöÄ Usage

### Option 1: Use it online

Visit the hosted version at [voice-generator.pages.dev](https://voice-generator.pages.dev) and start generating voices instantly!

### Option 2: Self-host with Docker

The self-hosted version includes an OpenAI-compatible API that works as a drop-in replacement for applications using [OpenAI's text-to-speech API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech).

```yaml
services:
  kokoro-web:
    image: ghcr.io/eduardolat/kokoro-web:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - KW_SECRET_API_KEY=your-api-key
    volumes:
      - ./kokoro-cache:/kokoro/cache  # Cache downloaded models and voices
    restart: unless-stopped
```

You can adjust the `compose.yaml` according to your needs or use docker run directly.

Then access the web UI at http://localhost:3000 and the API at http://localhost:3000/api/v1/index.html

### Option 3: Deploy on Cloudflare Workers (Containers Beta)

Cloudflare's new container support lets you run the Docker image close to your users while keeping the Worker entry point for routing and auth. The configuration in `wrangler.toml` already defines a container application and Durable Object binding; follow the steps below to deploy:

1. **Check plan access** ‚Äì Containers currently require a Workers Paid plan or beta access. Confirm the feature is available for your account in the Cloudflare dashboard before deploying.
2. **Install dependencies** ‚Äì `npm install`
3. **Authenticate Wrangler** ‚Äì `npx wrangler login`
4. **Configure secrets** ‚Äì If you need authentication, run `npx wrangler secret put KW_SECRET_API_KEY` (and any other `KW_*` secrets you use). These secrets are passed through the Durable Object so the container sees them as environment variables.
5. **Provision the container** ‚Äì `npx wrangler cloudchamber apply`
6. **Deploy the Worker** ‚Äì `npx wrangler deploy`

The Worker proxies every request to a long-lived container instance (keyed as `"global"`). You can adjust scaling, regions, or the image by editing the `[containers]` block in `wrangler.toml`.

#### Enable automatic storage for batch jobs

The batch queue in the UI can automatically push audio outputs to Cloudflare R2 when the `AUDIO_JOBS_BUCKET` binding is configured. To enable it:

1. Create an R2 bucket (for example `kokoro-audio-jobs`).
2. Update `wrangler.toml` with the bucket name if you chose something different.
3. Deploy the Worker after configuring the binding (`npx wrangler deploy`).

When this binding is missing, batch jobs will fall back to browser downloads only.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment variables

- **KW_SECRET_API_KEY** - Your API key for authentication. If left blank, authentication will not be activated

- **KW_PUBLIC_NO_TRACK** - Opt out of anonymous usage analytics

## üîå API Integration

Kokoro Web provides an OpenAI-compatible API that works as a drop-in replacement for applications using OpenAI's text-to-speech service:

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'http://your-kokoro-host/api/v1',
  apiKey: 'your-kokoro-api-key',
});
const speechFile = path.resolve("./speech.mp3");

const mp3 = await openai.audio.speech.create({
  model: "model_q8f16",
  voice: "af_heart",
  input: "Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!",
});

const buffer = Buffer.from(await mp3.arrayBuffer());
await fs.promises.writeFile(speechFile, buffer);
```
